	abstract = {Element identification is a cornerstone of automation testing, directly influencing the reliability, scalability, and efficiency of test scripts. With the rapid evolution of web and mobile applications, traditional element identification methods—such as {XPath}, {CSS} Selectors, and static attributes—are increasingly challenged by dynamic {DOM} structures, shadow {DOMs}, virtual {DOMs}, and hybrid frameworks. These challenges are further amplified in mobile environments, where gestures, native elements, and platform-specific attributes add layers of complexity.},

	abstract = {By the time this paper has been presented, the mobile app landscape will have changed. New {OS} versions will have been released. A bunch of new devices will have hit the market. And mobile application testing will have become that much more complex and challenging for all of us. There is no doubt that mobile applications need specific testing approaches. This paper wants to investigate new directions in research on the type of testing and skills required on mobile app testing by answering the following three research questions: ({RQ}1) How mobile applications testing are so different from traditional web applications, that require specialized testing skills and techniques?, ({RQ}2) What are the new challenges and future trends in mobile application testing, and ({RQ}3) How far automation effective in testing mobile application?. We answer those questions by analyzing the current trends in mobile application development and testing, and by proposing my view on the topic.},

	abstract = {With the rapid advance of mobile computing technology and wireless networking, there is a significant increase of mobile applications (apps). This brings new business requirements and demands in mobile software testing, and causes new issues and challenges in mobile test automation. Existing mobile application testing approaches mostly concentrate on {GUI}-based testing, load and performance testing without considering large-scale concurrent mobile app test automation, and model-based test coverage analysis. In this paper, a mobile hierarchical {GUI} model is proposed to present mobile operation scenario flows and gesture features in a hierarchical manner, in order to facilitate test dependency analysis in test automation. Mobile app test coverage analysis is performed based on {GUI} ripping models. The paper also presents a developed system that provides a test automation solution using {GUI} models. Finally, the paper reports a case study to indicate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Automated software testing aims to detect errors by producing test inputs that cover as much of the application source code as possible. Applications for mobile devices are typically event-driven, which raises the challenge of automatically producing event sequences that result in high coverage. Some existing approaches use random or model-based testing that largely treats the application as a black box. Other approaches use symbolic execution, either starting from the entry points of the applications or on speciﬁc event sequences. A common limitation of the existing approaches is that they often fail to reach the parts of the application code that require more complex event sequences.},

Even though such tests often have high coverage of the source code, we ﬁnd that they often focus on the expected behavior, not on occurrences of unusual events. On the other hand, automated testing tools may be capable of exploring the state space more systematically, but this is mostly without knowledge of the intended behavior of the individual applications. As a consequence, many programming errors remain unnoticed until they are encountered by the users.},
